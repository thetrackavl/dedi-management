## create a framework for api-based data population
- provide endpoint to call and any body values
- specify pod or dedi call
- indicate parameters to be populated by the call and mapping to api return values
- frequency of population
- values for those params on failure
- number of consecutive errors to consider a failure
- back off timing on calls after failure




## more thoughts
- incorporate logging member time
  - on the pod list, when a driver name matches a member
    - pop up a thing to say 'Want to log this?'
      - show benefits available to the driver
      - show benefits logged recently (last 7 days + highlight today)
      - choose drop-in, hot-laps, etc
      - quantity to log
      - confirm
